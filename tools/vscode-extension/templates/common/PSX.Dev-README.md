Welcome to your new PSX.Dev project!

In order to build your project, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the "PSX.Dev: Build Debug" command. You can also use the "PSX.Dev: Build Release" command to build a release version of your project.
You can also use the "PSX.Dev: Clean" command to clean your project, which is useful when switching between debug and release builds.

Additionally, you can build your project by running "make" in the terminal, or "make BUILD=Debug", and run "make clean" to clean your project.
There are also Visual Studio Code tasks for building and cleaning your project, which you can find in the "Tasks: Run Task" command.

And finally, you can debug your project by pressing F5. You will first need to have a GDB server running in the background, which you can do by running the "PSX.Dev: Launch PCSX-Redux" command. Please note that debugging won't work unless the recommended tools are installed.

Don't forget that you can always open the main PSX.Dev panel by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P and running the "PSX.Dev: Show panel" command, in order to get all of the relevant documentation and links from the TEMPLATES tab.

# PSX.Dev VSCode extension

This extension provides support for development of PlayStation 1 software. It lets you easily install various tools and libraries, as well as some templates for new projects.

In order to show the tools and templates panels, type the following in the **Ctrl-Shift-P** command palette: `PSX.Dev: Show panel`.

For more information on the tools and libraries, please refer to the [PSX.Dev website](https://psx.dev/). Also feel free to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QByKPpH) for support.

The panel will have the ability to install the tools on the most popular platforms, but there's definitely corner cases when it won't work. When manual installation is required, either look at the homepage provided for each tool, or check the [installation instructions](https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux/blob/main/src/mips/psyqo/GETTING_STARTED.md) provided in the documentation. Additionally, the TOOLS panel can leverage [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) to install dependencies on an unsupported Linux platform.
